Building
--------

Building the compiler is simple, just call make in the root directory:

```bash
cd <fcc>
make CONFIG=release
```

Makefile options (all optional):
- `CONFIG=[debug profiling release]`, default: `debug`
- `CC=[path to C11 compiler]`, default: `gcc`

Makefile targets:
- `all clean print`

This puts an fcc binary in `<fcc>/bin/$CONFIG`

Running
-------

The command line interface is similar to that of GCC:

Usage: `fcc [--version] [--help] [-cS] [-o <file>] <files...>`
- `-c`         Compile and assemble only, do not link
- `--help`     Display command line information
- `-I`         Add a directory to be searched for headers
- `-o <file>`  Output into a specific file
- `-s`         Keep temporary assembly output after compilation
- `-S`         Compile only, do not assemble or link
- `--version`  Display version information
